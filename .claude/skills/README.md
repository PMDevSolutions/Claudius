### Figma-to-React Pipeline Skills

These skills power the `/build-from-figma` and `/build-from-canva` autonomous pipelines. They run in sequence (Phase 1 through Phase 6) but can also be invoked independently.

#### 1. figma-intake (Phase 1)
- **Purpose:** Structured interview that auto-discovers Figma file structure, scans the local project, asks 3-5 targeted questions, and produces a `build-spec.json`
- **Triggers:** Phase 1 of `/build-from-figma`, or any Figma URL conversation
- **Output:** `.claude/plans/build-spec.json`

#### 2. design-token-lock (Phase 2)
- **Purpose:** Extracts all design values from Figma and writes a lockfile that becomes the single source of truth for colors, typography, spacing, and text content
- **Triggers:** Phase 2 of `/build-from-figma`, "extract tokens", "design tokens"
- **Output:** `src/styles/design-tokens.lock.json`, `tailwind.config.ts`, `src/styles/tokens.css`

#### 3. tdd-from-figma (Phase 3)
- **Purpose:** Writes failing tests for every component BEFORE implementation. App-type-aware: generates Chrome extension tests (popup, service worker, Chrome API mocks), PWA tests (manifest, offline), or standard web app tests.
- **Triggers:** Phase 3 of `/build-from-figma`, "write tests first", "TDD"
- **Output:** `src/components/**/*.test.tsx` (RED phase -- all tests fail)

#### 4. figma-to-react-workflow (Phase 4)
- **Purpose:** Orchestrates the full Figma-to-React conversion pipeline. Generates React components that pass the tests from Phase 3. Includes pixel-diff visual QA loop and quality gate.
- **Triggers:** "convert Figma", "Figma to React", "design to code"
- **Works with:** figma-react-converter agent, asset-cataloger agent

#### 5. e2e-test-generator (Phase 6)
- **Purpose:** Generates Playwright E2E tests from `build-spec.json`. App-type-aware: web apps get page navigation/form/responsive tests, Chrome extensions get load/popup/storage/content-script tests, PWAs get install/offline tests.
- **Triggers:** Phase 6 of `/build-from-figma`, "generate E2E tests", "Playwright tests"
- **Output:** `e2e/` directory with Playwright config and test files

#### 6. visual-qa-verification (Phase 5)
- **Purpose:** Automated pixel-diff visual QA using `scripts/visual-diff.js`. Captures Figma screenshots, renders the app, compares with pixelmatch, and iterates fixes up to 5 times. Includes cross-browser verification.
- **Triggers:** "visual QA", "compare to Figma", "screenshot diff", "verify app"
- **Works with:** visual-qa-agent, Chrome DevTools MCP, Figma MCP

### Canva Pipeline Skills

These skills power the `/build-from-canva` autonomous pipeline. They handle Canva-specific phases (1, 2) before converging with the shared pipeline (phases 3-9).

#### 7. canva-intake (Phase 1 -- Canva)
- **Purpose:** Structured discovery for Canva designs. Exports screenshots via Canva AI Connector MCP, uses Claude vision to analyze page structure and components, asks 3-5 targeted questions, and produces a `build-spec.json` with `source: "canva"`.
- **Triggers:** Phase 1 of `/build-from-canva`, or any Canva design URL conversation
- **Output:** `.claude/plans/build-spec.json`

#### 8. canva-token-inference (Phase 2 -- Canva)
- **Purpose:** AI-powered token extraction from Canva screenshots with confidence scoring. Uses Claude vision to infer colors, typography, spacing, and effects. Presents tokens with confidence levels for user confirmation before locking.
- **Triggers:** Phase 2 of `/build-from-canva`, "extract Canva tokens", "Canva design tokens"
- **Output:** `src/styles/design-tokens.lock.json`, `tailwind.config.ts`, `src/styles/tokens.css`

### React Development Skills

These skills provide patterns and best practices. They trigger on relevant keywords during any React development work.

#### 9. react-component-development
- **Purpose:** Component patterns, TypeScript conventions, custom hooks, composition, and Tailwind CSS best practices
- **Triggers:** "create component", "component pattern", "custom hook", "React best practices"
- **Works with:** frontend-developer agent, ui-designer agent

#### 10. react-testing-workflows
- **Purpose:** Testing strategy with Vitest, React Testing Library, Playwright, and Storybook
- **Triggers:** "write tests", "test coverage", "Vitest", "Playwright", "Storybook"
- **Works with:** test-writer-fixer agent, test-results-analyzer agent

#### 11. react-performance-optimization
- **Purpose:** Performance profiling, bundle analysis, code splitting, and Web Vitals
- **Triggers:** "performance", "bundle size", "Web Vitals", "lazy loading", "profiling"
- **Works with:** performance-benchmarker agent, analytics-reporter agent

#### 12. react-accessibility
- **Purpose:** WCAG 2.1 AA patterns for React, ARIA usage, keyboard navigation, focus management
- **Triggers:** "accessibility", "WCAG", "ARIA", "a11y", "keyboard navigation"
- **Works with:** accessibility-auditor agent, ux-researcher agent

#### 13. state-management
- **Purpose:** State architecture decisions — Zustand for global UI state, TanStack Query for server state, URL state patterns, and anti-patterns to avoid
- **Triggers:** "state management", "zustand", "tanstack query", "react query", "global state", "data fetching", "caching"
- **Works with:** frontend-developer agent

#### 14. form-handling
- **Purpose:** Form patterns with React Hook Form + Zod — typed forms, reusable field components, dynamic field arrays, multi-step wizards, server actions, and accessible error handling
- **Triggers:** "form", "form handling", "react hook form", "zod", "validation", "multi-step form", "wizard"
- **Works with:** frontend-developer agent, accessibility-auditor agent

#### 15. auth-flows
- **Purpose:** Authentication patterns — Auth.js v5 (NextAuth), Clerk, Supabase Auth. Covers session management, protected routes, OAuth, and role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Triggers:** "auth", "authentication", "login", "sign in", "session", "protected route", "OAuth", "clerk", "supabase auth"
- **Works with:** backend-architect agent, frontend-developer agent

#### 16. animation-motion
- **Purpose:** Animation patterns — Framer Motion (motion/react), CSS transitions, page transitions, scroll-driven animations, staggered lists, and reduced-motion accessibility
- **Triggers:** "animation", "framer motion", "transition", "micro-interaction", "page transition", "scroll animation", "motion"
- **Works with:** frontend-developer agent, whimsy-injector agent

#### 17. seo-metadata
- **Purpose:** SEO patterns — Next.js Metadata API, Open Graph tags, dynamic OG images, structured data (JSON-LD), sitemaps, robots.txt, and Vite SPA SEO with react-helmet-async
- **Triggers:** "SEO", "metadata", "open graph", "og image", "sitemap", "structured data", "json-ld", "meta tags"
- **Works with:** frontend-developer agent, content-creator agent
