# Visual QA Verification

## Overview

After the figma-react-converter agent generates React components and pages, this skill guides verification that the output matches the Figma source design. It covers screenshot comparison, responsive behavior, accessibility, performance, and asset rendering.

**Core Principle:** Every converted design must be visually verified before delivery. Build checks validate structure and types; this skill validates what the user actually sees in the browser.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- A Figma-to-React conversion has just completed
- Verifying generated components match their Figma source
- Running post-conversion visual QA
- Checking responsive behavior of generated pages
- Validating that all images and assets render correctly

**Symptoms that trigger this skill:**
- "verify app"
- "visual QA"
- "compare to Figma"
- "check screenshots"
- "does it match the design"
- "responsive check"
- "pixel-perfect"

## Verification Checklist

Run these checks in order after conversion completes.

### Step 1: Start Development Server

Start the React application and verify it builds and renders without errors.

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start dev server
pnpm dev

# Verify build passes (catches TypeScript errors, missing imports)
pnpm build
```

**Check the terminal output for:**
- Zero TypeScript errors
- Zero import resolution failures
- No runtime console errors on initial load

Open the browser console and verify no errors or warnings appear on page load.

### Step 2: Automated Visual Diff Loop

This is the core pixel-perfect iteration loop. It compares app screenshots against Figma source screenshots using `pixelmatch` via `scripts/visual-diff.js`.

**Configuration:** Read `.claude/pipeline.config.json` for thresholds and iteration limits:
- `iterationLoop.maxVisualIterations` — max fix attempts (default: 5)
- `iterationLoop.diffPassThreshold` — max mismatch ratio to pass (default: 0.02 = 2%)
- `iterationLoop.diffWarnThreshold` — mismatch ratio that triggers warning (default: 0.05 = 5%)
- `iterationLoop.regionAnalysis` — enable per-region diff reporting (default: true)
- `visualDiff.breakpoints` — breakpoints to test

**Breakpoints to test:**

| Breakpoint | Width | Description |
|------------|-------|-------------|
| Mobile | 375px | iPhone SE / small phones |
| Tablet | 768px | iPad portrait |
| Desktop | 1440px | Design canvas (Figma default) |
| Wide | 1920px | Full HD monitors (optional) |

**Automated Diff Loop:**

```
FOR iteration IN 1..maxVisualIterations:

  1. CAPTURE — For each page in build-spec, at each required breakpoint:
     a. Chrome DevTools MCP: navigate_page → page URL
     b. Chrome DevTools MCP: resize_page → breakpoint width
     c. Chrome DevTools MCP: take_screenshot → save to .claude/visual-qa/screenshots/chromium/
     d. Figma MCP: get_screenshot → save to .claude/visual-qa/screenshots/figma/

  2. DIFF — Run pixel comparison:
     ```bash
     node scripts/visual-diff.js --batch \
       .claude/visual-qa/screenshots/chromium \
       .claude/visual-qa/screenshots/figma \
       --output-dir .claude/visual-qa/diffs \
       --json
     ```

  3. ANALYZE — Parse JSON output:
     - For each file comparison:
       - IF mismatchPct <= diffPassThreshold → PASS
       - IF mismatchPct <= diffWarnThreshold → WARN (log but continue)
       - IF mismatchPct > diffWarnThreshold → FAIL
     - Check region analysis: identify specific problem areas

  4. DECIDE:
     a. IF all comparisons PASS:
        → Mark all pages as verified
        → Break loop
        → Log: "Visual QA passed on iteration {N}"

     b. IF any FAIL and iteration < maxVisualIterations:
        → For each failing comparison:
          - Read the diff image to identify problem areas
          - Read region analysis to pinpoint: "top-right has 12% mismatch"
          - Fix the specific component code causing the mismatch
          - Run: pnpm vitest run (ensure unit tests still pass)
        → Continue to next iteration

     c. IF any FAIL and iteration === maxVisualIterations:
        → Log remaining failures in build report
        → Save diff images for manual review
        → Mark page as "needs manual review"
        → Continue to next page
```

**Region-Based Fix Strategy:**

When the diff reports failing regions, use this mapping to prioritize fixes:

| Region | Common Cause | Fix Strategy |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| top-left / top-right | Header/nav issues | Check Header component layout, logo positioning |
| upper-* | Hero section | Check hero spacing, typography, image sizing |
| center-* | Main content | Check section spacing, grid layout, card sizing |
| lower-* / bottom-* | Footer / CTA | Check footer layout, padding, background colors |
| Full-width bands | Section backgrounds | Check section background colors, full-bleed containers |
| Scattered pixels | Anti-aliasing / fonts | Likely a pass — increase antialiasing tolerance |

**After the diff loop completes, save all artifacts:**
- Screenshots: `.claude/visual-qa/screenshots/{browser}/`
- Diff images: `.claude/visual-qa/diffs/`
- JSON report: `.claude/visual-qa/diff-results.json`

### Step 2.5: Cross-Browser Verification

After Chromium passes the visual diff loop, verify in Firefox and WebKit.

**Using Playwright MCP or cross-browser-test.sh:**

```bash
# Capture Firefox screenshots
./scripts/cross-browser-test.sh firefox http://localhost:3000

# Capture WebKit screenshots
./scripts/cross-browser-test.sh webkit http://localhost:3000

# Compare Firefox against Chromium baseline (not Figma)
node scripts/visual-diff.js --batch \
  .claude/visual-qa/screenshots/firefox \
  .claude/visual-qa/screenshots/chromium \
  --output-dir .claude/visual-qa/diffs/firefox-vs-chromium \
  --threshold 0.03

# Compare WebKit against Chromium baseline
node scripts/visual-diff.js --batch \
  .claude/visual-qa/screenshots/webkit \
  .claude/visual-qa/screenshots/chromium \
  --output-dir .claude/visual-qa/diffs/webkit-vs-chromium \
  --threshold 0.03
```

**Cross-browser threshold:** Use a slightly higher threshold (3% vs 2%) since browser rendering engines have legitimate differences in anti-aliasing, font rendering, and sub-pixel positioning.

**Cross-browser failures are NOT blocking** by default (configurable in `pipeline.config.json` → `qualityGate.crossBrowserScreenshotsRequired`). They are reported in the build report for manual review.

**Common cross-browser differences to ignore:**
- Font rendering (especially on macOS WebKit vs Windows Chromium)
- Sub-pixel anti-aliasing
- Scrollbar width differences
- Focus ring styling

### Step 3: Asset and Image Rendering

Verify all images and assets load correctly. This catches broken imports and missing files.

```bash
# Check for broken image imports in components
grep -r "src=\"\"" src/components/ --include="*.tsx" && echo "FAIL: Empty src found" || echo "PASS"

# Check that image imports resolve
grep -r "from.*\.\(png\|jpg\|jpeg\|webp\|svg\|avif\)" src/components/ --include="*.tsx"

# Check for hardcoded external image URLs (should use imports or public/ paths)
grep -r "src=\"http" src/components/ --include="*.tsx" && echo "WARN: Hardcoded URLs" || echo "PASS"

# Verify public directory assets exist
ls public/images/ 2>/dev/null || echo "No public/images/ directory"
```

**In browser:** Open DevTools Network tab, filter by "Img", reload page. Any 404s indicate broken image references or missing assets.

**Common issues:**
- Image import path is wrong (case sensitivity on Linux/CI)
- Asset not exported from Figma and placed in the project
- Using `<img src="">` instead of a proper import or public path
- Next.js `<Image>` component missing required `width`/`height` props

### Step 4: Responsive Behavior

Test that layouts respond correctly at each breakpoint.

**Check for:**
- Navigation collapses to mobile menu at mobile breakpoints
- Multi-column layouts stack on mobile
- Images scale proportionally (no overflow or distortion)
- Text remains readable at all sizes
- Touch targets are at least 44x44px on mobile
- No horizontal scrollbar on any breakpoint
- Tailwind responsive prefixes (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, `xl:`) applied correctly

**Common failures after conversion:**
- Fixed widths that should be fluid (`max-w-*` not `w-[fixed]`)
- Flexbox items that don't wrap (`flex-wrap` missing)
- Images overflowing containers (missing `max-w-full` or `w-full`)
- Grid columns not adjusting (missing responsive `grid-cols-*` variants)
- Text size not scaling (missing responsive `text-*` variants)

### Step 5: Lighthouse Audit

Run Lighthouse to catch performance and accessibility issues.

**Target scores:**

| Category | Minimum | Target |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Performance | 80 | 90+ |
| Accessibility | 90 | 100 |
| Best Practices | 90 | 100 |
| SEO | 90 | 100 |

**Using Chrome DevTools MCP:**
```
Run lighthouse_audit on the app's main page
```

**Common issues in generated React apps:**
- Missing `alt` text on images (accessibility)
- Large unoptimized images without lazy loading (performance)
- Missing `<meta name="description">` (SEO)
- Low color contrast ratios (accessibility)
- Large JavaScript bundles (performance -- check code splitting)
- Missing `<html lang="en">` (accessibility)

### Step 6: Accessibility Checks

Beyond Lighthouse, manually verify:

- **Keyboard navigation:** Tab through the page. Every interactive element must be reachable. Tab order must match visual order.
- **Focus indicators:** Visible focus rings on all focusable elements (`focus-visible:ring-*`).
- **Heading hierarchy:** h1 > h2 > h3, no skipped levels. One h1 per page.
- **Color contrast:** Text meets WCAG AA (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text).
- **Skip link:** First focusable element should be "Skip to content".
- **Landmark regions:** `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>` present with correct hierarchy.
- **ARIA attributes:** Interactive components have proper `role`, `aria-expanded`, `aria-label`, etc.
- **Screen reader:** Content reads in a logical order.

```bash
# Check heading hierarchy in components
grep -rn "<h[1-6]" src/components/ --include="*.tsx" | sort

# Check for missing alt attributes
grep -rn "<img" src/components/ --include="*.tsx" | grep -v "alt="

# Check for interactive elements without ARIA
grep -rn "onClick" src/components/ --include="*.tsx" | grep -v "role=" | grep -v "<button" | grep -v "<a "
```

## Design Token Verification

Confirm the app uses only design tokens from the Tailwind config, not hardcoded values.

```bash
# Check for hardcoded hex colors in components (should use Tailwind classes)
grep -rE '#[0-9a-fA-F]{3,8}' src/components/ --include="*.tsx" | grep -v "// token:" | grep -v ".css"

# Check for hardcoded pixel values in Tailwind arbitrary values (should use scale)
grep -rE '\b(w|h|p|m|gap)-\[' src/components/ --include="*.tsx"

# Check for inline styles (should be rare or absent)
grep -r 'style={{' src/components/ --include="*.tsx"
```

**Verify in browser:**
- Change a color in `tailwind.config.ts` or `tokens.css`, restart dev server -- it should update everywhere
- Change a font size token, restart -- all matching text should update
- Change spacing tokens, restart -- all matching spacing should update

## Common Failures

### 1. Fonts Don't Match

**Symptom:** Body text or headings use wrong font family.

**Cause:** Font not loaded, or Tailwind `fontFamily` config doesn't match the CSS import.

**Fix:** Check `tailwind.config.ts` > `theme.extend.fontFamily` and verify fonts are loaded via `next/font` (Next.js), `@fontsource` packages (Vite), or a CSS `@import` from Google Fonts.

### 2. Colors Are Close But Not Exact

**Symptom:** Colors are visibly different from Figma.

**Cause:** Figma uses a different color space, or variables were not resolved correctly.

**Fix:** Re-extract color palette from Figma using `get_variable_defs` or `get_design_context`. Ensure Figma color mode is sRGB.

### 3. Spacing Feels Wrong

**Symptom:** Elements are too close or too far apart vs. the design.

**Cause:** Figma auto-layout padding/gap values were not mapped to the Tailwind spacing scale accurately.

**Fix:** Compare Tailwind config spacing values against Figma auto-layout settings. Add custom spacing values to `tailwind.config.ts` if they don't fit the default scale.

### 4. Images Missing or Broken

**Symptom:** Placeholder boxes or broken image icons.

**Cause:** Image assets were not exported from Figma, import paths are incorrect, or the file extension doesn't match.

**Fix:** Export images from Figma at 1x and 2x. Place in `public/images/` (static) or `src/assets/images/` (imported). Verify import paths are correct and case-sensitive.

### 5. Layout Breaks at Certain Breakpoints

**Symptom:** Content overlaps or overflows at specific viewport widths.

**Cause:** Missing responsive Tailwind variants or incorrect breakpoint logic.

**Fix:** Add responsive prefixes (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`) to layout classes. Test at every breakpoint in the table above, not just the extremes.
