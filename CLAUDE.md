# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a **Claude Code-integrated multi-framework app development framework** providing specialized agents, skills, scripts, and design-to-code conversion pipelines. Supports React, Vue 3, Svelte/SvelteKit, and React Native (Expo) output targets.

The framework is designed for:
- Multi-framework app development (React/Next.js/Vite/Remix, Vue 3, SvelteKit, React Native/Expo)
- Figma-to-code, Canva-to-code, and Screenshot/URL-to-code conversion with Tailwind CSS
- Comprehensive testing (Vitest, React Testing Library, Playwright, Storybook)
- Full product lifecycle support (engineering, design, testing, marketing, operations)

### Figma-to-React Pipeline

**Single command:** `/build-from-figma <Figma URL>`

Autonomous 9-phase pipeline that converts a Figma design into a working, tested React app:

```
/build-from-figma https://figma.com/file/abc123

  [0] TOKEN SYNC    → sync-tokens.sh → drift check (conditional, if lockfile exists)
  [1] INTAKE        → figma-intake skill → build-spec.json (with appType)
  [2] TOKEN LOCK    → design-token-lock skill → design-tokens.lock.json
  [3] TDD (HARD GATE) → tdd-from-figma skill → failing tests (Red)
  [4] BUILD         → figma-to-react-workflow → components pass tests (Green)
  [4.5] STORYBOOK   → generate-stories.sh → auto-generated stories (non-blocking)
  [5] VISUAL DIFF   → pixelmatch loop → max 5 iterations, 2% threshold
  [5.5] DARK MODE   → check-dark-mode.sh → dark mode verification (non-blocking)
  [6] E2E TESTS     → e2e-test-generator skill → Playwright tests (app-type-aware)
  [7] CROSS-BROWSER → Firefox/WebKit screenshots (non-blocking)
  [8] QUALITY GATE  → coverage + types + build + tokens + Lighthouse + mutation score (opt-in)
  [8.5] RESPONSIVE  → check-responsive.sh → screenshots at 5 breakpoints (non-blocking)
  [9] REPORT        → .claude/visual-qa/build-report.md (with diff images + docs)
```

**Key artifacts:**
- `design-tokens.lock.json` — Single source of truth for all design values
- `build-spec.json` — Machine-readable build plan with appType, outputTarget (`"react" | "vue" | "svelte" | "react-native"`), and E2E flows
- `pipeline.config.json` — Thresholds, iteration limits, app-type definitions
- `verify-tokens.sh` — Catches hardcoded values and token drift
- `verify-test-coverage.sh` — Ensures every component has tests
- `visual-diff.js` — Pixel-level screenshot comparison with region analysis
- `sync-tokens.sh` — Detects token drift between lockfile and source
- `check-dark-mode.sh` — Dark mode screenshot capture and visual comparison
- `generate-stories.sh` — Auto-generates Storybook stories from components
- `generate-component-docs.sh` — Generates MDX component documentation

**Features:**
- **Enforced TDD** — tests must exist before components, hard gate blocks build phase
- **Pixel-perfect visual diff** — `pixelmatch`-based comparison (not manual), up to 5 iterations
- **App-type awareness** — Chrome extensions, PWAs, React Native, and web apps get tailored E2E strategies
- **Chrome extension E2E** — Playwright persistent context with `--load-extension`
- Design token extraction with lockfile enforcement
- Cross-browser verification (Firefox, WebKit) with configurable thresholds
- Quality gate: 80%+ coverage, TypeScript, Lighthouse audit
- Resumable: TodoWrite tracks progress across interrupted sessions
- **Dark mode verification** — automated dark theme screenshot comparison (non-blocking)
- **Storybook generation** — auto-generated stories with responsive viewports
- **Token sync** — detects drift between Figma lockfile and source code
- **Component docs** — auto-generated MDX documentation with props, tokens, and links
- **Automated hooks** — pre-commit token guard, coverage warnings, dark mode reminders, Lighthouse CI, bundle size guard, mutation testing
- **Responsive verification** — automated screenshots at 5 breakpoints (320-1920px)
- **Error monitoring** — Sentry integration configured via pipeline.config.json
- **Deploy previews** — Vercel auto-deploy with visual QA on PRs

**Documentation:** `docs/figma-to-react/README.md`

### Canva-to-React Pipeline

**Single command:** `/build-from-canva <Canva URL>`

Same 12-phase pipeline as Figma with Canva-specific phases 1, 2, and 4:

- **Phase 1:** canva-intake (vision-based discovery via Canva AI Connector MCP)
- **Phase 2:** canva-token-inference (AI extraction with confidence scoring + user confirmation)
- **Phase 4:** canva-react-converter agent (builds components from screenshots)
- **Phases 3, 5-9:** shared (identical to Figma pipeline)

**Documentation:** `docs/canva-to-react/README.md`

---

### Screenshot/URL-to-App Pipeline

**Single command:** `/build-from-screenshot <URL or image paths>`

Same 12-phase pipeline as Figma/Canva with screenshot-specific Phase 1:

- **Phase 1:** screenshot-intake (captures URL or reads provided images, vision-based discovery)
- **Phase 2:** canva-token-inference (shared, accepts screenshot source)
- **Phase 4:** framework-specific converter agent dispatched by `outputTarget` (vue-converter, svelte-converter, react-native-converter, or figma-react-converter)
- **Phases 3, 5-9:** shared (identical to Figma/Canva pipeline)

Supports all output targets: React, Vue 3, Svelte/SvelteKit, React Native (Expo).

**Documentation:** `docs/screenshot-to-app/README.md`

---

### Multi-Framework Output

The `outputTarget` field in `build-spec.json` controls which framework the pipeline generates code for:

| Target | Value | Converter Agent | Test Library | Template |
|--------|-------|----------------|-------------|----------|
| React | `"react"` | figma-react-converter / canva-react-converter | Vitest + RTL | `templates/nextjs/` or `templates/vite/` |
| Vue 3 | `"vue"` | vue-converter | Vitest + @vue/test-utils | `templates/vue/` |
| Svelte | `"svelte"` | svelte-converter | Vitest + @testing-library/svelte | `templates/sveltekit/` |
| React Native | `"react-native"` | react-native-converter | Jest + @testing-library/react-native | `templates/expo/` |

Framework auto-detection: if `outputTarget` is not specified, the pipeline detects the framework from `package.json` dependencies and config files (e.g., `next.config.*`, `svelte.config.*`, `app.json`).

**Documentation:** `docs/multi-framework/README.md`

---

### MCP Server Integration

- **Figma Desktop MCP** - Local Figma integration (port 3845)
- **Figma Remote MCP** - Fallback remote access
- **Playwright MCP** - Cross-browser testing (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
- **Chrome DevTools MCP** - Screenshots, Lighthouse audits, DOM inspection
- **Canva AI Connector** - Search, export, and interact with Canva designs
- **Sentry** - Error monitoring (configured via pipeline.config.json, setup by error-boundary-architect agent)

---

### Automated Hooks (7 Total)

Configured in `.claude/settings.json` as `PostToolUse` hooks on the `Bash` matcher:

| Hook | Trigger | Action |
|------|---------|--------|
| Post-build QA reminder | `pnpm build` succeeds | Reminds to run quality gate (vitest, tsc, verify-tokens) |
| Pre-commit token guard | `git commit` detected | Runs `verify-tokens.sh`, warns if violations found |
| Dark mode reminder | `visual-diff.js` passes | Suggests running `check-dark-mode.sh` |
| Coverage enforcement | `vitest` with coverage output | Reminds to check 80% threshold from pipeline config |
| Lighthouse CI | `pnpm build` succeeds | Suggests Lighthouse audit with threshold targets from config |
| Bundle size guard | `git commit` detected | Warns if build output exceeds maxSizeKb from config |
| Mutation testing reminder | `vitest` all tests pass | Suggests running Stryker for test quality validation |

## React Development Standards

### TypeScript
- Strict mode enabled
- No `any` types - use proper interfaces and generics
- Export prop interfaces alongside components
- Use discriminated unions for complex prop patterns

### Component Patterns
- Functional components only (no class components)
- Custom hooks for reusable logic
- Composition over inheritance
- Props interface for every component
- `children` and `className` passthrough where appropriate

### Tailwind CSS
- Utility-first styling
- Design tokens via Tailwind config (not hardcoded values)
- Responsive with mobile-first breakpoints (sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl)
- Use `cn()` utility for conditional classes (clsx + tailwind-merge)

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit tests** (Vitest): Pure functions, custom hooks, utilities
- **Component tests** (RTL): User interactions, rendering, accessibility
- **Visual tests** (Storybook): Component states, responsive variants
- **E2E tests** (Playwright): Critical user flows, cross-browser

### Accessibility
- WCAG 2.1 AA minimum
- Semantic HTML (landmarks, headings hierarchy)
- ARIA attributes on interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation support
- Color contrast 4.5:1 minimum

### Code Quality
- ESLint with React, TypeScript, and jsx-a11y plugins
- Prettier for formatting
- 2-space indentation (JS/TS/CSS/JSON)
