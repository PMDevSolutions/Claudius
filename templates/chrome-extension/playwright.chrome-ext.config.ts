/**
 * Playwright configuration for Chrome Extension E2E testing.
 *
 * Chrome extensions require a persistent browser context with the extension
 * loaded via --load-extension flag. This means:
 * - Only Chromium is supported (Firefox/WebKit don't support --load-extension)
 * - Headless mode is NOT supported for extension testing
 * - The extension must be built before running tests
 *
 * Usage:
 *   1. Build the extension: pnpm build
 *   2. Run tests: pnpm exec playwright test --config=playwright.chrome-ext.config.ts
